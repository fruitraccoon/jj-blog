Hello! I'm Jono and this is my blog.

Creating a blog is something that's been in the back of my mind for quite a while, and finally here it is. I'm not really sure what it will turn out like, but unless I actually do it, I'll never know!

This is quite a simple setup (for now, at least) - I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)[^1] to generate a static website from [markdown](https://commonmark.org/) files, which is then hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). My intention is to remove obstacles that dissuade me from actually writing; like _"What tools should I use to build a blog?"_ and _"How should it be hosted?"_. These questions are important, but ultimately distract from the actual goal. I'm hopeful that this setup will prove to be simple, but will allow me to expand and change things as I wish, while also not getting trapped by a blogging version of "vendor lock-in".

I enjoy reading, thinking and learning about a wide range of topics. But in my role as a software developer, I come across many technology-related topics that interest me - so most likely software and technology-related things will be most prevalent here.

By writing things down, I'm hopeful that:

1.  **It should help me to further clarify my thoughts** - there's nothing like trying to explain something to show you where the gaps in your understanding are.
2.  **It might help someone else** - I've been helped by countless bloggers in the past, so giving something back feels like the right thing to do.

What I anticipate to be the most difficult thing about writing is the age-old **finding the time**. Life always seems to be filled with many different competing priorities. Even when I narrow the focus to time I've already decided to spend on "technology things" I have to decide between writing about something I've learned, or learning something new - and the pull to learn something new is always strong!

So if I'm able to (even just occasionally) jot down a few thoughts here, then I think it will count as a win - something is better that nothing ðŸ™‚. And if it manages to help someone, even if it's just future-me, then that's icing on the cake.

So thanks for taking the time to read this, and good luck with your own journey!
